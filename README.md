# Iris Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Iris dataset** using `pandas` for data exploration and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization.  
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning that contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*).

The project demonstrates:
- Loading and exploring a dataset
- Cleaning and summarizing data
- Performing basic analysis (grouping and statistics)
- Visualizing the data with multiple plot types

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **seaborn** – for more visually appealing plots
- **scikit-learn** – for loading the Iris dataset

---


python Iris_Analysis.py
The program will:

Load the dataset

Display dataset information and summary statistics

Show several plots (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)

📊 Visualizations Included
Line Chart – Sample trend over index

Bar Chart – Average petal length per species

Histogram – Distribution of sepal length

Scatter Plot – Sepal length vs. petal length

✅ Findings
Setosa has the smallest petal and sepal sizes.

Virginica has the largest average petal length.

There is a clear relationship between sepal length and petal length, especially for Virginica.
